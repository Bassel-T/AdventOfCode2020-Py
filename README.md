# AdventOfCode2020-Py

The "Advent Of Code" is a 25-day challenge for programmers starting on December 1st every year. This challenge is comprised of problems that can be easily solvable by hand, though they would take too long. Hence, programmers are incentivised to code something to provide the answer. This repository contains my solutions in Python.
